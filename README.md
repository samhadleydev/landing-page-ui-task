# Landing Page UI Task

This project is a simple landing page for an online event built using WordPress. It was originally built for a job interview but I have uploaded it here to preserve it and use it for reference for future projects.

I learned a lot about WordPress in the process and got to know my way around Beaver Builder (wpbeaverbuilder.com) in the process - which I went from tolerating to really enjoying using.

I have tried to use modern UI design features like glassmorphism and bold, expressive fonts. I have also applied accessability guidelines, such as using headings where they are needed and using colours that are easy to see against the background.
